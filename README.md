## Getting Started

First, run `npm i` to install dependencies.

Then start up the Node server application and run `npm run dev` to start up this Next application.

You will need to ensure that you have added the `.env` file to the Node application with the password which should be sent to you. If not please contact the recruitment agency.

## Details

The application is a simple example of how it could consume the APIs in the Node application.

It includes:

- Homepage - Lists all the courses and allows some simple sorting methods - Ascending and descending by Course Title, and an input to limit the number of courses displayed.
- New Course Page - This allows you to add a new course.
- Edit Course Page - This allows any courses to be edited or deleted.
- React Course Page - This serves as an example of returning courses based on the React tag.

## With More Time

With more time I would have wanted to do the following:

- Break down into smaller components. For example, creating a edit form component, or making the NewCourseForm component reusable for this purpose.
- Install Jest and add in unit tests.
- Improve the styling.
- In hindsight I would have commit more frequently as I built up the applicaiton rather than one large commit.
